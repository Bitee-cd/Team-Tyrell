Team-Tyrell

Google landing page created using React App with some features subsituted for SideHustle's.
Team Tyrell consisting of 10 members worked on the 5 divisions of this project to make it successfull. Components including Navbar, Search, Button ,Footer and Body was divided between members and also the writing of an article on hashnode.
The team consisted of 10 members; and the team lead, Bitiyong Caleb, broke down the different components needed to create the homepage into five. After which he assigned each component to every member of the team. Thompson Esther and Akinleye Paul worked on the navbar component, Oussadi Karim and Olagunju Tomisin Enoch worked on the logo and search bar component, Champion Ovuakporie and Joseph Mensah on the footer component, while Theophilus Isah and Zayyad Musa worked on the buttons and languages components respectively. Abdul-Azeez Halimah Olaolohun worked on writing the documentation and publishing of the article for the capstone project.
It was ensured that all members of the group contributed to this project for the main purpose of individual development and also working with other people.

Some of the difficulties and hindrances faced during the development of this project were: shortage of electricity which made some of the team members available only at night. Also, beginners in reactjs with no prior idea of how to use git or install node packages had to learn it; and at the same time apply the knowledge; working on the assigned task.

So far, the experience of team tyrell members learning reactjs in the side hustle internship varies. While some considered it too tasking and not for beginners, another set of people think it is the best thing they have ever participated in; as it made them push themselves harder, learn and create things they would never have thought they were capable of; especially working as a team.
